# Call Center Analysis (By using Power BI)
This Power BI project analyzes call center performance data from January to March 2021 to deliver interactive dashboards for operational and customer service insights. It integrates data segmented by month, agent, resolution status, and call outcome. The dashboards showcase key performance indicators such as average speed of answer, call resolution rate, agent satisfaction scores, and monthly call volumes. Visualizations include bar charts, pie charts, performance quadrants, and time-series breakdowns for in-depth analysis. The solution empowers stakeholders to monitor efficiency, evaluate agent performance, and enhance customer support operations through data-driven decision-making.

## Dataset used
Dataset = "https://github.com/SubhankarMukherjee-portfolio/Call-Center/blob/main/Call-Center-Dataset.xlsx"

## Objectives of the project
1) To track and visualize call center performance using KPIs such as average speed of answer, call resolution rate, and customer satisfaction scores.
2) To evaluate individual agent performance based on metrics like call volume handled, satisfaction ratings, and resolution efficiency.
3) To analyze monthly trends in call volume and response effectiveness to identify peak periods and operational bottlenecks.
4) To assess resolution rates and categorize calls by outcome (resolved vs. not resolved) for service quality improvement.
5) To deliver actionable insights through interactive and drill-down Power BI dashboards that support informed decision-making in customer service management.

## Questions solved
1) What is the average speed of answer during the analysis period?
2) What is the overall customer satisfaction score for the call center?
3) What percentage of calls were resolved versus not resolved?
4) How many calls were answered and not answered each month?
5) Which month had the highest call volume?
6) How does call resolution rate vary by agent?
7) Which agents have the highest customer satisfaction ratings?
8) Who are the top-performing agents based on combined KPIs?
9) What are the trends in call volume and performance over the three months?
10) What is the distribution of calls by resolution status and by answer status?

## Final Observations & Storyline
Between January and March 2021, the call center handled a total of 4,938 calls, out of which 4,054 (81.08%) were answered and 884 (18.92%) were not. Among the answered calls, 72.92% were successfully resolved, indicating a strong resolution rate, while 27.08% remained unresolved. The average speed of answer stood at 67.52 seconds, reflecting moderately responsive service levels. The overall average customer satisfaction score was 4.50 out of 5, showing a positive user experience. Agent-level analysis revealed that Martha achieved the highest satisfaction score of 3.47, while Joe had the lowest at 3.33, despite both handling over 480 calls. February saw the lowest total call volume (1,616), while January peaked at 1,772 calls, suggesting some seasonal or operational fluctuation. The agent performance quadrant chart visualized productivity against satisfaction, identifying potential training or optimization opportunities. A pie chart illustrated the answered vs. not answered call distribution, and bar charts highlighted monthly volumes and agent metrics. Overall, the dashboard enables real-time monitoring and data-driven decision-making to enhance efficiency and customer support quality.
